
1. Steps to run the Code and expected output

Please run the file simulationTask3_npathak2.py and provide the following input parameters
Mean inter-arrival time 1/Î» = 17.98 sec
Service time s (vary it from 11 to 17)
Mean retransmission time 1/d = 5 sec
Buffer size B = 10
Number of repetitions N = 50

After each simulation, the code generates an output file called S(Service Time)Table.txt where Service time is the input service time.
It contains the mean values, total time and 95th percentile values generated on 50 repetitions. 

For each value of service time, this, table can be used to find grand mean, grand 95th percentiles and total times. 
Some sample S(Service Time)Table.txt files have been attached in the solution in a zipped folder called Task1_tables.zip


2. Also, a file called output.doc and a pdf version output.pdf is provided that contains the tables, graphs and comments as asked in the assignment.
